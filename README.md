## Meet Chimeline
Chimeline is a prototype social media website written in React & Express. Mainly inspired by old Twitter, it aims to bring the vibe of websites from around 2010-2015. Intended features include:

- Early 2010s styling;
- Posting;
- Reacting (likes, reposts, comments);
- Replying to comments;
- Profiles;
- Attaching media to posts;
- Custom accent colors;

This project is being used as a way for me to practice React + Express and general web development concepts. It may not be updated often, or display many amateur bugs.
